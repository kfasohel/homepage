                    <h6>Overview</h6>
                    <p>
                        Arabic is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world and has been used for thousands of years. It's also one of the six official languages of the United Nations. Although you may know a few facts about Arabic, here are 10 interesting things that you might not have known beforeâ€¦
                    </p>

                    <h6>Over 300 Million Native Speakers</h6>
                    <p>
                        Arabic is the seventh most spoken language in the world with over 300 million native speakers. The figure rises to well over 400 million when non-native speakers are included. It is an official language in 26 countries and is spoken across a further four. The Arab League, an organisation representing Arab states, has 22 members and four observers who all use Arabic as an official language. Several varieties of Arabic are used across the world and differ somewhat in terms of pronunciation and vocabulary, but are all mutually intelligible. Modern Standard Arabic is widely used in print and broadcast media, as well as in education and religious contexts. Many works of classical Arabic literature are still read today, while Modern Standard Arabic is used to write news reports, poems, novels and plays. Due to its wide usage, many loanwords from other languages have been adopted into Arabic, contributing to its rich and unique vocabulary.
                    </p>

                    <h6>One of the Oldest Languages</h6>
                    <p>
                        Arabic is thought to be one of the oldest languages in the world, with roots dating back to the early centuries CE. The language is most closely related to Hebrew and Aramaic, and it is believed that Arabic began to diverge from these other languages around the time of the Islamic conquests in the 7th century. Arabic has played an important role in the development of many other languages, particularly in the fields of science and religion. For example, Arabic was used as a lingua franca by scholars during the Golden Age of Islamic Civilization, and it has also been influenced by subsequent versions of the Quran. Today, Arabic is spoken by more than 422 million people across the globe, making it one of the most widely-spoken languages in the world.
